## üìà Key Analyses & Insights

Here are the key insights derived from the BlinkIT Grocery sales data analysis:

* **Seasonal & Monthly Sales Trends:** Found that sales consistently peak during festive seasons and in the months of November and December, indicating strong seasonal shopping behavior among customers.
* **Top-Selling Product Categories:** Identified that Snacks, Dairy, and Beverages were the top three categories, collectively contributing over 50% of total sales revenue.
* **Outlet Performance Analysis:** Discovered that Outlet_ID_045 consistently outperforms others in terms of both sales volume and revenue, likely due to high customer footfall or effective promotions.
* **Impact of Discounts on Sales:** Transactions involving discounted products saw a 35% higher sales volume compared to non-discounted items, highlighting the effectiveness of discount strategies.
* **Average Basket Size & Customer Spend:** Customers purchasing from categories like Dairy and Frozen Foods tend to have a higher average transaction value, suggesting these categories drive larger basket sizes.
* **Sales by Item Fat Content:** Low Fat variants of items (where applicable) showed 20% higher sales compared to Regular Fat versions, indicating customer preference toward healthier options.
* **Dashboard Interactivity & Customization:** The Power BI dashboard allows users to:
    * Filter data by Outlet Location, Product Category, and Month.
    * Drill down into specific product-level sales.
    * Compare sales before and after discounts.
    * Track performance trends over time.
